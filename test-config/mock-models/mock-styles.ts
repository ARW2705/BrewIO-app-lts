        description: 'American craft beer lovers are huge fans of the IPA. The quest for more of the India pale ale flavor has led them to the imperial India pale ale, a stronger version of the American IPA, which boasts even more hoppy flavor, aroma and bitterness. Imperial India pale ale is darker in color than the American IPA, substantially more bitter, and high in alcohol by volume. This all-American take on the IPA leaves craft beer fans with plenty of new creations to try.',
